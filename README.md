0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

Learning Objectives
- General
	- At least four different sorting algorithms
	- What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
	- How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
	- What is a stable sorting algorithm


Requirements
- General
	- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
	- All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
	- Betty style of coding and documentation
	- The use of global variables are not allowed
	- No more than 5 functions per file
	- Unless specified otherwise, you are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, â€¦ is totally forbidden.
	- All header files must be guarded

Tasks
- Mandatory
	- 0. Bubble sort: implementation of a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm
	- 1. Insertion sort: implementation of a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm
